        <p>Well <span>{{person}}</span> settled down in the Valley and hung his wild years on a nail that he drove through his wife's <span>{{noun}}</span>. He sold used <span>{{objects}}</span> out there on San Fernando Road and assumed a $30,000 loan at 15 and 1/4%. He put a down payment on a little 2 bedroom place. His wife was a <span>{{adjective}}</span> type of <span>{{noun2}}</span>, made a good <span>{{beverage}}</span>, kept her mouth shut most of the time. Had a little Chihuahua named <span>{{name}}</span> that had some kind of skin disease and was totally blind. They had a thoroughly modern kitchen, self-cleaning oven, the whole bit. <span>{{person}}</span> drove a little sedan. They were so happy.</p>

        <p>One night <span>{{person}}</span> was on his way home from work, stopped at the <span>{{place}}</span>, picked up a couple of <span>{{beverage}}</span>. Drank 'em in the car on his way to the Shell station. He got a gallon of <span>{{liquid}}</span> in a can. Drove home, doused everything in the house, torched it. Parked across the street, laughing, watching it burn. All Halloween orange and chimney red. Then <span>{{person}}</span> put on the top 40 station, got on the Hollywood Freeway headed north. Never could stand that dog.</p>

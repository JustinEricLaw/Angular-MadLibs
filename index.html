        <p>Well {{person}} settled down in the Valley and hung his wild years on a nail that he drove through his wife's {{noun}}. He sold used {{food}} out there on San Fernando Road and assumed a $30,000 loan at 15 and 1/4%. He put a down payment on a little {{number}} bedroom place. His wife was a {{adjective}} type of {{noun 2}}, made good {{beverage}}, kept her mouth shut most of the time. Had a little Chihuahua named {{name}} that had some kind of skin disease and was totally blind. They had a thoroughly modern kitchen, self-cleaning oven, the whole bit. {{person}} drove a little sedan. They were so happy.</p>

        <p>One night {{person}} was on his way home from work, stopped at the {{place}}, picked up a couple of {{beverage}}. Drank 'em in the car on his way to the Shell station. He got a gallon of {{liquid}} in a can. Drove home, doused everything in the house, torched it. Parked across the street, laughing, watching it burn. All Halloween orange and chimney red. Then {{person}} put on {{musician}}, got on the Hollywood Freeway headed north. Never could stand that dog.</p>
